# Battleship
This is a clasic battleship game made with the purpose of practicing **test driven development** with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

I focused on having a nice ship placement mechanic that felt good to use, which was a great opportunity to implement a **drag and drop** system for the first time, in this case, through [the native API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

The app also features a selfmade **enemy AI**.
## How to play
Place ships by dragging them into the gameboard and rotate them by clicking. Press **READY** to start the game.

Take a shot at the enemy field by clicking on a cell, and the enemy will attack back. Gray means a miss shot, while red means a hit.

The game ends when all of your or the enemy's ships are sunk.
