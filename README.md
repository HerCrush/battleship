# Battleship
This is a clasic battleship game made with the purpose of practicing test driven development with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

I focused on having a nice ship placement mechanic that felt good to use, which was a great opportunity to implement a drag and drop system for the first time, in this case, through [the native API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

The app also features a selfmade enemy AI.
